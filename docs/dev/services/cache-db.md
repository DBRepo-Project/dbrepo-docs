    * Ports: 6379/tcp

    To directly access in Kubernetes (for e.g. debugging), forward the svc port to your local machine:

    ```shell
    kubectl [-n namespace] port-forward svc/cache-db 6379:6379
    ```

## Overview

The Cache Database contains cached metadata and credentials that automatically expire after a set time.

## Configuration

By default, all items stored have a time-to-live (TTL) of `60` seconds. This can be changed by setting `CACHE_TTL` in
the [Metadata Service](/metadata-service),
[Data Service](/data-service)
and [Consumer Service](/consumer-service) according to
the [Valkey documentation](https://valkey.io/commands/ttl/).

!!! warning "Disable Caching"

    Disable caching in a service by setting the environment variable `CACHE_TTL=-1`.
