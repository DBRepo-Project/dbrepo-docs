## Description

The Subway Transportation Data-Dataset is a comprehensive and dynamic collection of data that captures the intricate
details of the city's public transportation system. This dataset encompasses a wide array of information, including bus
and tram schedules, subway routes, ticketing details, and real-time updates on vehicle locations.

## Solution

We wrote an algorithm that parses open data (available) information from Wiener Linien, Vienna's public transportation
agency directly and feeds it, after some cleaning, into DBRepo on a 5-minute interval.
